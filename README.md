# My NodeJs Journey. üöÄ

I've been using PHP as my primary backend language for some time, I learned Laravel at some point and built APIS with it. But most projects I collaborate on use NodeJS and I feel learning NodeJS would up my game as getting a job as a Software Engineer.

## What I've Learnt So Far üòÑ

1. NodeJs and what it is
2. NPM packages, package versioning, building and publishing your own NPM package.
3. ExpressJs, building APIs with express, request verbs (PUT, DELETE, POST, GET), HTTP Status codes
4. Handling request payloads
5. Advanced Express topics, building maintainable routes
Connecting to MongoDB, and using Mongoose.
7. Creating Schemas and Models
8. Express Middlewares and Building Custom Middlewares
9. Authentication and Authorization


## Inspirations üôå

Some people inspired me to learn NodeJs, most of them don't know but I am super happy to begin this journey

1. Pastor Yinka (YinTan)
2. Benrobo
3. Teni
4. Phenyl
5. Paul Ugochuwuku(Santa Clause)
6. Joseph (OperaConga)
7. Agu Christopher
8. Chris (he-is Chris)
9. Kachi (cosmo-duck)
10. David Dixx

And my other nodeJs developers. I would finally be able to collaborate with you guys on any backend project. :)

## What I Would Be Building üè†

I would be building a backend API for a book website, users can sign-up, download books, pin books to their library and all that good stuff. Admins can add books and all, admins can also add moderators to do stuff on their behalf.
To take this to the next level, I would add a platform for payment where users can buy premium books and integrate Paystack API for payments. That would widen my understanding of backend development and building APIs in general
