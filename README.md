# My NodeJs Journey.

I've been using PHP as my primary backend language for sometime, I learnt Laravel at some point and built APIS with it. But most projects I collaborate on use NodeJS and personally I feel learning NodeJS would really  up my game as getting a job as a Fullstack Engineer. 


# What I've Learnt So Far

1. NodeJs and what it is
2. NPM packages, package versioning, building and publishing your own NPM package.
3. ExpressJs, building APIs with express, request verbs (PUT, DELETE, POST, GET)
4. Handling request payloads
5. Advanced Express topics, building maintainable routes
6. Connecting to MonogoDB, and using Mongoose.
7.
