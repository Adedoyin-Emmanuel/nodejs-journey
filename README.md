# My NodeJs Journey.

I've been using PHP as my primary backend language for sometime, I learnt Laravel at some point and built APIS with it. But most projects I collaborate on use NodeJS and personally I feel learning NodeJS would really  up my game as getting a job as a Fullstack Engineer. 

# Inspirations

Some people inspired me to learn NodeJs, most of them don't know but I am super happy to begin this journey

1. YinTan
2. Benrobo
3. Teni
4. Phenyl
5. Paul (Santa)
6. Joseph
7. Agu christopher
8. Chris (heischris)

And my other nodeJs developers. I would finally be able to collaborate with you guys on any backend project. :)
