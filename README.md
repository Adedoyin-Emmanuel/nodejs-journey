# My NodeJs Journey. 🚀

I've been using PHP as my primary backend language for sometime, I learnt Laravel at some point and built APIS with it. But most projects I collaborate on use NodeJS and personally I feel learning NodeJS would really up my game as getting a job as a Software Engineer.

## What I've Learnt So Far 😄

1. NodeJs and what it is
2. NPM packages, package versioning, building and publishing your own NPM package.
3. ExpressJs, building APIs with express, request verbs (PUT, DELETE, POST, GET), HTTP Status codes
4. Handling request payloads
5. Advanced Express topics, building maintainable routes
6. Connecting to MonogoDB, and using Mongoose.
7. Creating Schemas and Models
8. Express Middlewares and Building Custom Middlewares

## Inspirations 🙌

Some people inspired me to learn NodeJs, most of them don't know but I am super happy to begin this journey

1. Pastor Yinka (YinTan)
2. Benrobo
3. Teni
4. Phenyl
5. Paul Ugochuwuku(Santa Clause)
6. Joseph (OperaConga)
7. Agu christopher
8. Chris (heischris)
9. Kachi (cosmoduck)
10. David Dixx

And my other nodeJs developers. I would finally be able to collaborate with you guys on any backend project. :)

## What I Would Be Building 🏠

I would be building a backend API for a book website, users can signup, download books, pin books to their library and all those good stuff. Admins can add books and all, admins can also add moderators to do stuffs on their behalf.
To take this to the next level, I would add a platform for payment where users can buy premium books and integrate Paystack API for payments. That would widen my understanding about backend development and building API's in general
